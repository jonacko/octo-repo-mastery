## 1. Summary

This project was undertaken as a submission for a Birmingham University Bootcamp assignment, with a brief to build the back end for an e-commerce site. The task inclued taking a working Express.js API and configuring it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.  The user story and acceptance criteria is as follows:

## 2. Key features:

- connects to SQL database using Sequelize
- db is seeded with test data using schema & seed commands
- data for each route (products, tags, categories) displays in Insomnia Core in a formatted JSON
- API, POST, PUT, DELETE routes test successfully in Insomnia
- data is successfully created/updated/deleted depending on user input


## 3. Issues encountered/further amendments

As far as I understand, all acceptance criteria are met.  However when recording my first video I did encounter the below syntax error when making any request - after all the requests having previously worked.  The issue was resolved after restarting the server and insomnia, but I would like to look into this and find out what caused the issue!

You may also notice in my video my troubles around 5:15 with the "unsupported protocol" error... took me me a bit of time to figure that one put but got there in the end..!
